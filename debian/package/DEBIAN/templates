Description: Run Mifos X on standard ports?
 The default port to run Mifos X is 8443.
 If you want, Mifos X can be configured to run on
 the standard HTTPS port 443, but it is generally
 considered a security feature to not run java on
 ports below 1024 which are called PrivilegePorts.
 If you don't already have another web server running
 on that standard port, and you really want to run
 Mifos X on standard port 443, you may select this.
